This relation is transitive.</p><p>Unlike tetris, pieces always fall to the bottom, that means no 'hole' can appear in the stack of filoos. Particularly, when blocked, the current falling filoos can split in two.</p><p>It is possible to earn extra point by chaining disappearances: when a group disappears, the filoos on top of it fall down, what might cause new groups to be formed and to disapear aswell, and so on.</p><h2>Keys</h2><table><tr><td>up</td><td>rotate counter clockwise</td></tr><tr><td>down</td><td>rotate clockwise</td></tr><tr><td>right</td><td>move to the right</td></tr><tr><td>left</td><td>move the the left</td></tr><tr><td>space</td><td>drops to the bottom</td></tr></table>"
