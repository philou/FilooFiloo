  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>This game point of this game is to make disappear the falling puyos buy grouping them by four or more of the same color.</p>
  <p>The gameplay is tetris like, only the currend falling puyos can be controlled.</p>
  <p>Two puyos are in the same group if they have the same color, and if they are in adjacent cells, diagonals do not work. This relation is transitive.</p>
  <p>Unlike tetris, pieces always fall to the bottom, that means no 'hole' can appear in the stack of puyos. Particularly, when blocked, the current falling puyos can split in two.</p>
  <p>It is possible to earn extra point by chaining disappearances: when a group disappears, the puyos on top of it fall down, what might cause new groups to be formed and to disapear aswell, and so on.</p>
